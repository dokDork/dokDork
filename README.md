# 👨‍💻 About me
Hi, I’m **@dokDork**.
I think that loving security means loving knowledge.

# 🏴‍☠️ Uncertainty principles of cyber security
+ **First principle**: there is no upper limit to the amount of security that can be applied to a system.
+ **Second principle**: no matter how much security has been inserted into a system, the system will still be hackable.
+ **Third principle**: Time erodes the security of a system.

# 📖 So what can we do?
To make a system secure you must get as much information as possible about that system, you must analyze it from many points of view trying to understand how to change its predefined behavior.
Hacking is a methodology that allows you to analyse system much deeply then most people can. 
Hacking requires you to increase your knowledge every day.
