# 👨‍💻 About me
Hi, I’m **@dokDork**.
I think that loving security means loving knowledge.

# 🏴‍☠️ Uncertainty principles of cyber security
+ **First principle**: there is no upper limit to the amount of security that can be inserted into a system.
+ **Second principle**: no matter how much security has been inserted into a system, the system will still be hackable.
+ **Third principle**: Time erodes the security of a system.

# 📖 So what can we do?
To make a system safe we must know a system in as much depth as possible, analyze it from as many points of view as possible.
Hacking is a methodology that allows you to achieve all this increasing your knowledge every day.
